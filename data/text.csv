"@MSNBC @MaddowBlog ‚ÄúSimpleton‚Äôs defense‚Äù?  You mean convincing voters that hardworking tax payers shouldn‚Äôt have to pay off someone else‚Äôs student loan?  Not to mention, it‚Äôs illegal."
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog I feel sorry for the suckers who fell for this student loan forgiveness scam and voted for Joe.
"@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Setting up a 2024 elections tsunami against rePublicans on: Climate; Mass Shootings; Abortion; and now, Student debt forgiveness."
"@MSNBC @MaddowBlog If you can't pay off student loans getting a job with the degree you earned, means all that time and money was pretty much wasted doesn't it?  Person A's poor choices shouldn't be person B's debt to pay off."
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog The simple defense is why should I pay for my own student loans and everyone elses?  Its ridiculous what Fuhrer Biden is pushing these days.
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Nothing simple about it this Student loan forgiveness is UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
@FoxNews The money they squander. Tax payers money. $85 Billion in Assets from Afghanistan. Pay off student loans.... Where does it end.
"@MSNBC Here‚Äôs an idea, how about MSM do their job and start calling out the hypocrisy of Republicans who took millions in PPP $ but are too selfish to give some struggling people 10k for a student loan-shame them."
@MSNBC Ppp loans were all forgiven for Rich but poor working people still gonna have to pay student loans per Republicans .  Republicans love to sue and keep poor poor .
@FoxNews End the #Ukraine money grab.!!   Pay-off all student loans first as an investment in America‚Äôs future.! (I am 63 - Doesn‚Äôt affect me)  ‚Äî End ALL @USAID NOW
"@MSNBC Did you just discover who Biden is?  Next up from MSNBC ""hey guys, Biden made student loans non-dischargable  as a favor to banks, can you believe this breaking news????"""
@FoxNews Stop Federal Funding and student loans to attend these schools.
"@FoxNews He's having issues isn't he. He can't pass a ban on pew pews, he can't do student loan forgiveness (kind of intentional btw,) he can't pass gas because his heads in the way of natural progression in his bum.  He just can't catch a break man. üò™"
@CNN Let's see how much they believe in the Constitution after the courts declare the Student Loan Forgiveness unconstitutional.
"@MSNBC And it won‚Äôt be the last! Biden has proven he will do anything to stay in power; lied he had congressional approval for student loan forgiveness, lying his son Beau died in Iraq, lied he graduated at the top of his class, etc. just a pathetic patsy &amp; liar!"
@FoxNews Will this also be covered by the 'student debt forgiveness'?
@FoxNews This makes no sense...Ukrainian oligarchs can't vote in US elections...maybe they have outstanding student loans....
"@CNN What?????? You mean you can‚Äôt write some kind of executive order to fix this?  Just like you can forgive student loans?  Yes Joe, congress has to power but you do not!"
@CNN Just like the student loan BS..remember before the election China Joe said because of his negotiations there will be no l rail strike. How long will CNN allow China Joe and his administration to spread their BS?
@FoxNews Biden will use this to keep the pandemic going in the US so it justifies him giving student loan relief..
@MSNBC MSNBC as usual ignores that the whole Biden Student debt forgiveness WAS for votes to divert attention from  all other failed policies.
"@MSNBC President Biden lied to the gullible people, who actually thought they were going to receive student loan forgiveness. üòÇ"
@MSNBC I don‚Äôt care about who dines with Trump.  I care that my health ins premium is going up next year but my coverage stays the same.  I care about my student loan relief being blocked by Republicans.  I‚Äôm so tired of your obsession with this man.  He‚Äôs not worth it.  Move on.
@MSNBC Republicans are not afraid to say they are against student loan bribes. It is irresponsible and unconstitutional.
@FoxNews that's why they can't pay back their student loan
@FoxNews Before the election he promised student loan forgiveness and averting the rail road strike. Looking like neither will happen. Reviewing all his non-accomplishments I can see why there are so many post here naming him the worst president ever.
"@FoxNews You mean like someone saying their son died in Iraq. My wife was killed by a drunk driver, the student loan payments will resume on Jan st it is time to start repaying."
@nytimes We know that joementia is a liar isn't that right student loan forgiveness people yay let's go Brandon
@FoxNews Eff Biden and his unconstitutional student loan handout. Biden just wants to create a generation of grifters like he and his corrupt family are. Whoever signed for the loan pays the loan!!!
"@FoxNews Since educations/schools have turned into money machines for decades.  Those student loans, would be better to be written off by the universities, colleges, or business schools?  Regardless, It shouldn‚Äôt be paid by taxpayers."
@usedgov Wait times for customer service @MOHELA are currently 4 HOURS. This organization does not have the capacity to provide federal student loan service.  Please investigate.
@FoxNews they should work part time to pay off their student loan instead of bludging on the taxpayers
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Kind of like telling 92 million Americans who have student loans they don't have to pay them back! DUH!
@usedgov I applied for student loan forgiveness on October 15. I still haven't received an email telling me whether or not I've been approved.
@CNN Cnn is racist thats all they talk about is how racist everybody is that is what racist do all my black white mexican and asian freinds think its all bullshit if biden would not have lied about student loans being paid off we would of hade the red wave hes lucky kids are gulable
@FoxNews Meanwhile senior citizens are starving   Veterans in living a cardboard boxes.   And young people who paid off all their student loans are getting shafted
@FoxNews But guns...but gay marriages...but student loans...but UK...but but but...
"@FoxNews Yeah, Biden, promising to drop student loans isn‚Äôt classified as ‚Äúbuying votes?‚Äù"
@FoxNews Democrats! Same as paying off student loans tp buy votes!
@FoxNews I wonder what the viewpoint would be if an examination of the recent student loan forgiveness effort were performed?
@FoxNews Shouldn't Biden get the same for the student loan forgiveness?  That was basically buying young votes.
@FoxNews Thank God I'm not paying for anyones student loan! Or they can pay for my car payment.
@FoxNews And Republicans celebrate no student loan relief for teachers and nurses. Smh
@FoxNews I hate to be trite but... .ü§£Pay off your own damned student loans just like the rest of us had to.
@FoxNews Wrong to make low income and blue collar workers pay off kids student loans because they didn‚Äôt want to work while going to college!!!! Get a damn job and pay your own debts!
"@FoxNews Joe, you cannot spend money without Congress approval. Student loan is not a National Security issue. Have them get a job and pay their own billls like others had to do!"
"@FoxNews If Joe Biden were being intellectually honest about his actions to cancel student debt he would name them ""The Burdening of People who didn't go to College with the Debt of those who did Act"". Biden's student debt forgiveness plan may cost taxpayers an average of $2,000, per CNBC"
@FoxNews Gimme my student loan forgiveness and I‚Äôll consider you to be a half decent human being
"@FoxNews The student loan forgiveness program served its purpose, buying votes heading into the midterms.  Surely Biden knew it was illegal."
@FoxNews Democrats knew this was a bullshit ploy to get votes.   Biden doesn‚Äôt have the authority to cancel student loans.
@MSNBC How do people feel their not getting their student loan forgiveness?
"@FoxNews Looks like all the student loan people that voted for Biden voted for a bribe pre-election that constitutionally can't be carried out. If you vote don't vote for personal favors vote for your country. With Biden in the office look at what you've done to our country. Economy, war."
"@FoxNews He should not just say he is going to take care of student loans, he is buying votes and lying to the American citizens"
@FoxNews Your also forgetting the fact that he helped put a stop to student loan forgiveness! #TRUMP2024ToSaveAmerica
@FoxNews NOT A STINKING PENNY FOR STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS!!
@FoxNews Just did this to help try and get votes. Pay your student loans just like everyone else did in the past. Congress won't pass this.
"@FoxNews I never had a student loan, will they pay my house off instead?"
"@FoxNews Just a thought, but why don't colleges and universities with their HUGE endowments pay off some student debt? Better yet, how about low or no interest student loans? The accruing interest makes it seem insurmountable to pay off loans for students."
"@FoxNews Political theater just like everything Joe Biden does all show no substance. He knows his actions in forgiving student loans are not legal. He‚Äôs a showman, a ConMan doing it solely to ingratiate himself with the left."
@FoxNews So everybody that has already paid their student loans should get all their money back too
@FoxNews That isn‚Äôt want Nancy Pelosi said. She said Biden does not have the authority to forgive student loans like that üòè
@FoxNews Now I knows he‚Äôs full of it in regards to student lone debt forgiveness.If Biden thinks the same Supreme Court that overturned roe v wade is going to back him he‚Äôs nuts or he‚Äôs just blowing smoke up his base‚Äôs ass to get votes.
"@FoxNews Student debt is numbers on screen. Sh$t to be honest thats what we all are. Americans are in debt because of student loans. I believe that if u have a degree, then u should be student debt loan forgiven. Or there should be requirements ! Why not ?"
@FoxNews In a Christian Nation people blocking someone else blessing.  If I had to pay my student loans everybody else should pay theirs too.
@FoxNews NO STINKING MONEY FOR STUDENT LOANS FORGIVENESS!!!
@FoxNews Explain to me why I should pay YOUR student loan debt when I worked two jobs to put myself through college so I would not have college debt. How is that fair in any level.
@FoxNews I don‚Äôt want my student loans forgiven. I‚Äôd be tremendously greatful if they lowered the predatory interest rates though. Some of mine are as high as almost 7%. Makes it hard to even make a dent in the principle.
"@FoxNews Then reimburse the millions of Americans who paid their student loans off, including me over a 10 yr period."
@FoxNews He trying to buy votes but who will get stuck paying these student loans the taxpayers!
"@FoxNews It‚Äôs ok, I forgave myself, my student loans are between the government and god now"
@FoxNews An email was sent to people with student loans that stated their loan would be reviewed for debt forgiveness if they applied. A link was in that email asking for information related to the loan. Why would this be done if the program wasn‚Äôt already approved?  Why????This is nuts.
@FoxNews It was promised so they should get it! It's not fair to give all this money each month to people with kids that can also work and people without kids get nothing. People who have student loans do have jobs and have been working the whole time and need help! COVID put them behind
@CNN Student loan forgiveness once again üëé
@FoxNews I don‚Äôt have any student loans but I‚Äôll take 20 bucks.
"@FoxNews Ok, so how is this fair to the people who have paid their student loans off???... And is this fair to the American tax payers who will ultimately pay for this."
"@FoxNews And how is this equitably when the millions of other students and families had to work multiple jobs and years and years to pay thier student loans. Basically what this does is now makes those families and students, along with other kids who couldn‚Äôt afford to go to college pay"
@FoxNews The PPP loans were given to businesses that kept their employees on payroll after the government FORCED them to close shop.  Student loans are what people WILLINGLY sign up for to pay for their education. The terms are made clear before they start.  They are NOT THE SAME.
@FoxNews If you sign a credit application to get a loan it‚Äôs a promise to repay.  It‚Äôs their debt!!! I paid my own student loans and so did most other people.  I resent paying other peoples bills.
"@FoxNews President Biden, I remember who payed off my student loans it was me. I applied for the loan. So I paid that loan. It‚Äôs just that simple."
"@FoxNews I have student loan debt myself, but I dont expect my neighbor to pay for it. Maybe think about addressing the ridiculously high cost of higher education."
@FoxNews How many people between the ages of 18 - 38 voted for Biden solely on the expectation he would forgive student loan debt? #Duped
"@nytimes Gov Puto (Abbott)! Doesnt ""blocking"" Pres Biden student loan plan HURT Texans who voted for you!?"
"@FoxNews If Biden really wants to help ALL Americans how about giving us all 1 year interest free from credit cards, home loans, car loans and student loans?"
@FoxNews Hey communists how‚Äôs that student loan forgiveness going for y‚Äôall? Lol. Lied to again by a old pedo communists.. Pedo Peter strikes again. Noticed he likes fucking kids.. ha ha ha ha
@FoxNews I wonder how many people realize that any student loan forgiven just means we all share the cost of that person's debt.
@FoxNews keep in mind that the Rosetta stone gives instructions and reasons to forgive all debts not just student loans but all loans üôè
"@FoxNews Student debt is a national crisis. It's easy to get a school loan, not enough guarantees that you can make enough money to pay it back. I think the cost of college degrees should vary by the income you will have in that field of work. Student loan debt relief is great."
@FoxNews Of course the SC rejected.  JB does not have authority to forgive student loan debt.
@FoxNews Student loans is fraud there I said it
@FoxNews I wonder how many folks realize that Jesus addressed the basis on which many folks object to student loan forgiveness in Matthew 20: 1‚Äì16.
"@FoxNews Just remember it was your Commander in Sleep that introduced the bill that was later signed into law  thatnypu couldn't file bankruptcy on student loans, and turned the higher education game into a money making business! Want dept relief, regulate the amount a school can charge."
@FoxNews It‚Äôs not his money to give away‚Ä¶..students in the past had to PAY for their student loans‚Ä¶.
@FoxNews I paid my student loans by WORKING! Sometimes 2 or 3 jobs. I've also seen plenty of students using student loans for nice cars and expensive vacations. This is nothing more than buying votes with money the government doesn't have.
"@FoxNews Whether forgiving student loans is fair or not doesn‚Äôt matter because Democrats had (and still have) the option to forgive loans in a Constitutional manner (through legislation), but chose not to. Biden‚Äôs executive order was illegal, plain and simple"
"@FoxNews Dems in 2020: We want a $15 minimum wage, but the parliamentarian said no  Dems in 2022: We want student loan forgiveness, but the courts said no  Democrats love playing the victim card when THEY‚ÄôRE the ones that hold power"
"@FoxNews How many votes will Biden lose from those who never took student loans or paid their student loans and now have to pay someone else‚Äôs? If I‚Äôm 20 years old and I have to pay your student loan, I‚Äôm voting for the other guy!"
@FoxNews How jealous and weird do you have to be to worry about someone else's debt? I paid my student loans too and I'm happy for anyone that can get relief from this greedy government
"@FoxNews Us  taxpayers must be crazy to want them to pay their own student loan debt and not strap it to our backs. It's the same smoking mirror is the Democrats have been using for 50 years, and the younger generation is too naive to understand it's all smoke and mirrors!!!!"
@FoxNews Sleepy Joe you can't spend student loan money. What if some of us would like to continue our education? How about that one?
"@FoxNews Somebody didn't go to school.....there!!!! Hello sweetie, it is ""their""....I guess you don't need to be concerned with student loans now do you?"
"@FoxNews Better Idea, since the federal government started securing student loans the price has increased to this extreme. How about we limit the ever increasing student loan interest percentage and bring it to the percent at the beginning of the loan. mine went from 4% to 18%."
"@FoxNews The 3 judges voted it was not legal. One was a Trump appointee, one an Obama appointee and One a Bush appointee. All three voted against Biden's student loan handout. Law is upheld."
"@FoxNews Ill be the firat to say I think thay college is over proced and the loan system is set up to rip people off. I have student loans and they suck. While i would love fpr someone to pay them for me, thats not realistic. I willingly took put these loans, so it is my responsibility"
@FoxNews Great because I don‚Äôt wanna pay anybody‚Äôs student loan. You take out a loan you pay the damn thing back yourself
@FoxNews How about my mortgage? Can he get rid of it? Or perhaps I can send him my canceled checks from my student loans I paid? #WPE
@CNN old fake news lets us know when ot is the same price it was when THE BIG GUY  took office and then he can find a way to reimburse us for the thousands of dollars extra we spend on his mistakes never mind student loan forgiveness
@FoxNews Why doesn‚Äôt Biden just pay for everyone‚Äôs student loan‚Ä¶ and if your dumb idea ever goes thru then I want all my money back from putting my two kids through college‚Ä¶
@FoxNews Confident that student loan handouts are legal ???? And he cant even carry on a  Conversation to make any sense.... We have a SENILE PRESIDENT  OF OUR COUNTRY !!!!!! LAUGHING STOCK OF THE WHOLE WORLD !!!
@FoxNews When you go to college and get a student loan you know you have to pay it back. @JoeBiden cannot legally do this. Pay your loans! It‚Äôs not my responsibility to pay your loan for you. This is just a ploy for votes. WAKE UP PEOPLE! It‚Äôs not that hard to figure out he‚Äôs a fraud.
@FoxNews Soon enough the student loan crisis will be one a matter of national security.
@FoxNews I was forced to get a student loan and spend it on holidays. It was so long ago that they cancelled the debt lol
"@FoxNews I had to pay my student loan, everyone I know did - so get off your butts and start sending in those payments."
@FoxNews i bet all those in support of student loan payback  are living at home with PARENTS HOUSE
@FoxNews Can you forgive my home loan? Since my student loans I paid already? No difference.
"@FoxNews How can invalidating a valid contract be legal in anyone's book.  How about a good plan, helping to pay for college tuition from this day forward.  Going back and invalidating contracts is a disasterous policy.  Plus debt forgiveness crushes credit scores.  Talk about that."
"@FoxNews Well if you can pay off all the student loans they willingly got themselves into then I want all my credit card debt, car loans , rv loans my mortgage etc etc that I willingly got myslef into debt for wiped away as well FAIR IS FAIR"
"@FoxNews Biden's plan excludes FFELP borrowers and this is simply unconscionable. Fix the student loan crisis the right way, legislatively, or not at all. All Americans should be included."
@FoxNews We don't need student loan forgiveness not right now we got other problems or we can use that money for matter of fact too many problems
@FoxNews Well it looks like the President conveniently made promises to get votes. He knew student loan forgiveness was just smoke and mirrors. I see how he is blame shifting to look like the good guy for the next election. ü§£
@FoxNews Where is my student loan forgiveness? My wife and I pay for her continuing education out of pocket right now what do we get back as actual working lower middle class living week to week?
@FoxNews The GOP is trash. And the courts are against us.  Let's just collectively stop paying back our student loans. What are they going to do? Tank our credit scores? Who the fuck cares? It's not like we'll ever be able to afford houses anyway.
@FoxNews Are you surprised that the president lied about student loan debts. Anytime he openns his mouth it is a lie!!!! It has been like this for yrs and yrs he is all for the Mighty old dollar for him and his own! People we have to fight to keep tnis beautiful country
"@FoxNews I love Joe Biden, but I do not believe that federal student loans should be forgiven.  That is not fair to other student loans, and not fair to kids who can‚Äôt afford to go to college."
@FoxNews Student debt forgiveness is fundamentally unfair to everyone else who paid their own or who opted out of college because they knew they weren't financially able.
@FoxNews How could that be fair to people who have paid out the wazoo for their student loans
@FoxNews And then you want to forgive student loans‚Ä¶.
"@FoxNews BS!!! Let them pay it off like the rest of us have!!! I had great satisfaction when I made my final student loan payment! Some lean years, but I paid it off in full. Simple math; your borrow, you pay back!!"
"@FoxNews I‚Äôll eventually get my student loans paid off as it‚Äôs my responsibility, but what a waste of time and money. School isn‚Äôt worth it."
@FoxNews I did not have help with my student loan
@FoxNews He is hoping his dream lasts long enough to gain votes for the Dems in next election.  He knows this could go on for years. You just can't go forgiving some people's student loans and not everyone's. üôÑ
@FoxNews A lot of these people who complained about student loan also have the latest iPhone and all the channels on Cable TV.  Yellen is partially right.
@FoxNews Just Say No To Student Loan Welfare...
@FoxNews Take a good look at this America this is FOX news /comedy  broadcasting. The Republicans have stopped your help with student loans what party care for the American people ?Democrats !!!
"@FoxNews It‚Äôs funny how Republicans supported the bank bailout back in 2008, but won‚Äôt support helping average Americans on the student loan agenda, which is really a Ponzi scheme to exploit Americans and keep them in debt so politicians and their cronies can get rich."
"@FoxNews Funny how REPUBLICANS were against student loan debt relief, veterans relief, 9/11 relief, disaster relief in ‚Äúblue‚Äù states or jurisdictions but were more than happy to cut taxes on the rich &amp; corporations and give handouts to rich ppl or their base. Pure hypocrisy"
"@FoxNews He says the economy is great, that he's created millions of jobs, and that unemployment is low. However, people with student loans can't afford to make their loan payments."
"@FoxNews You don't know what the next person had to endure on their journey. What about some of these doctors, lawyers, etc that don't pay back a dime and they have the resources to. You frown about the less unfortunate not being able to pay their student loan debt;"
"@FoxNews Why am I responsible to pay for your student loan debt?  I paid for my education by extra jobs..  Oh that's right, nobody wants to work anymore and wants free government handouts."
"@FoxNews What about my car debt? My credit card? My mortgage? If student loans can be forgiven, why not all the others? They are all CHOICES!"
@FoxNews My student loans were forgiven and for that I‚Äôm eternally grateful. But my situation was different. I fell on my job and am now permanently disabled and unable to work any longer as a nurse. My income abruptly changed to being 100% below the poverty level.
"@FoxNews Personally, it's not the student loan (SL) debt that I have a problem with...it's the 4.8-6% interest rate on SL. For a 40k bachelor's degree, nearly 6% interest is difficult to pay. If legislation changed to make interest on SL nonexistent then that'd be the way to go instead."
"@FoxNews If they get studen loan forgiveness, we all get credit debt forgiveness. Same bullshit."
"@FoxNews Since I don't have any student loans I'd like for the government (Taxpayers), to payoff my mortgage.  Where do I sign up?"
"@FoxNews Yes n yes we do have student loans yo pay and work really hard to pay them back , amongst other Bill's, but when the economy dosent pay us enough to fulfill  our responsibilities we are stuck , or when covid hit , we still cant even get any money  that is owed to us ,"
"@FoxNews Why not regulate the interest rate that can be charged on student loans. Connect it to an index and let it float. That way it‚Äôs manageable to pay, and at the same time it‚Äôs not forgiveness. It‚Äôs a middle ground.  Government can also make payments deductible. It‚Äôs a win win."
@FoxNews Maybe free financial counseling for those struggling to repay their student loans. Financial Peace University is a great school to attend!
@FoxNews My kids paid off their student loans. Why should anyone have to pay off your student loans. I could care less what political party you are affiliated with. This is wrong on so many levels. It took more than one job to payoff student loan debt. Pay yours.
"@FoxNews Disclaimer: I paid off my burdensome student loan in 2010, it wasn‚Äôt easy to do so, but I‚Äôm glad I did. Biden‚Äôs stunt sets a bad precedent, and ‚Äúc‚Äômon man,‚Äù not hard to see why he announced this before the mid-terms."
"@FoxNews Sure, let's just ignore how the democrats think the solution to anything is to throw money at it. Like how Biden wants to spend money so that kids won't have to pay back their student loans."
"@FoxNews I paid my student loans off and I think those who took them out should do the same!  Also, why should the people who did not go to college have to pay for others student loans."
"@CNN Here comes everyone stating what ""they paid."" Everyone bitter about someone having a reduction in their student loan should write a book on their life so we can all make sure that no changes are made from your life experiences to next generations."
@CNN Student loan debt relief plan was an absolute disaster. You can‚Äôt afford to pay 30 billion per year when you have other problems that are more important like inflation and war
@CNN @cnnbrk NO to student loan debt relief! END the indefinite payments &amp; interest pause!
"@CNN @cnnbrk This debt relief plan is a SLAP IN THE FACE to everybody who diligently paid off their student loans, as well as a slap in the face to taxpaying Americans!!!"
@usedgov @usesgov @potus #studentloanforgiveness #ppploans it should be brought before the appellate court the suggestion that if Biden does not have the authority to forgive student loans then Trump didn't have the authority to forgive PPP Loans that only helped the wealthy even Senators

@FoxNews paying off student debt will only increase student tuitions;  its like attaching the Bull from behind we all know what your going get from that end of the Bull. reducing  tuition costs would do more to reduce the burden. AOC doesn't deserve student loan forgiveness
"@FoxNews Many of the people with student loans have already said they will use the money to buy stuff or go on vacation.   If the Government wants to ""pay"" on these student loans they need to pay the lender - who as of now is actually the government- pay them directly!! Not the borrower"

@FoxNews Must have been all the young people who thought they we‚Äôre getting their student loans forgiven. üôÑ
@MSNBC But you want every single Americans tax money to pay off student loan debt for the people who voluntarily took on said debt. I did not attend college. Why should I be forced to pay for someone else's debt?
@NPR I love how the supreme court has a say in government overreach when people might get money but when the gov sold our student loans without our permission at a higher interest rate no court was there to stop that!
"@MSNBC Good, tax payers shouldn't be on the hook for the student loans. Thier decision not ours. GROW THE F UP"
@FoxNews I paid my student loan off. It took working part time during college and writing checks long after. I understood the concept in  high school.
"@NPR How about, in the meantime, Congress just rewrites the law that makes student loan debt so hard to discharge through bankruptcy.  Then start figuring out ways to make the universities more liable for their education that ends up being not useful."
@FoxNews It‚Äôs is a student LOAN not a hand out. This is illegal!! if you approve of this then you‚Äôre a crook.
"@FoxNews The answer isn't paying off existing student loans, it's capping student loans going forward. Capping student loans would bring down tuition cost dramatically."
@FoxNews So that‚Äôs why they can‚Äôt afford their student loans.
@FoxNews This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äústudent debt relief plan‚Äù it‚Äôs real name is ‚ÄúStuden loan reassignment plan‚Äù. It transfers the loan payments to citizens who didn‚Äôt take out a student loan. Remember this next time you VOTE!
@FoxNews @POTUS pay me back for my student loans and my children‚Äôs too. If you signed for the loan then pay it back‚ÄºÔ∏è
@FoxNews Well Union Joe and his clowns sold a scram on the people with student loans to get votes then sold them out and now sold out all his Unions backers After he got their votes.
"@FoxNews Why not just make student loans interest free so long as the loan is kept in good standing? Why excuse debt for something they chose to do? My mom died from cancer &amp; my stepdad is still paying those bills almost 3 years later. But yeah, let‚Äôs do away with student loans"
"@FoxNews FJB &amp; your student loans!!! You signed up for your student loans, so flipping pay them youself like I did!!! If he does anything he should do medical bill forgivness, people don't have a choice on medical bills. It's life we didn't sign up for hospital bills like you did for loan"
"@FoxNews I can't believe how heartless. a single mom of 2. I went to college. Went to local schools. Pell grant, scholarships, still needed loans. Now I work hard supporting family, but student loan is more than car payment. Not practical or considers living expenses."
@FoxNews Nope...I paid my student loan off...since you want to pay everybody's student loans off why don't you pay my car note off?? That seems fair...we pay theirs then they can pay ours with they're money
"@FoxNews That's a great idea, we pay for their student loans since our economy is doing so well and the rest of us foot the bill. Is there any thing else the Dems have in store to make us poorer?"

@FoxNews Here‚Äôs a novel idea why not forgive the student loans only after the student had performed 5 consecutive years working in their field of study and degree.  Or after 4 years of military service either or.  The idea that student loans should have blanket forgiveness is laughable-
"@FoxNews Splurged by spending all that ""free"" money biden gave them, just like those that want their student loans paid so they can travel and eat out. That's what created inflation."

@FoxNews I have 5 sons and 3 stepsons. 4 of them went to college and racked up student loan debt. The boys that didn‚Äôt go to college have mortgages and car loans. What‚Äôs the difference? I‚Äôd rather teach them personal responsibility equally and help them budget and live within their means.

@NPR Drop this court case now. Democrats still have majority in House and Senate. They can pass this through legislation if they act immediately. Waive student loans now.
"@FoxNews If you want student loan relief, start at the colleges!  See how those liberal commie professors like it when the Gov starts setting their prices."
@FoxNews Let‚Äôs file a Class Action suit against the Federal Government for predatory lending on students and settle the suit with Student loan Forgiveness.  Come on!  The SCOTUS had not issue with forgiving much larger debts of FOR PROFIT corporations and allow many to forgo taxes.
"@FoxNews President Biden as they say ‚ÄúAll hat and no cowboy!‚Äù If he really interested in helping students with their education loans, he could stop Government predatory interest rates on student loans, and better yet get greedy Government out of the business of student loans all together!"
@FoxNews Didn‚Äôt the Dems nationalize student loans to fund Obamacare? Are we going to see a $300 billion cut to that program?
"@FoxNews Found out the online ""college "" I was going to was a fraudulent college. STILL had to pay my student loans back, 13 yrs but pd them all off! U take out the loans, u pay them!!"
@FoxNews Student loan forgiveness is not fair and equal on ANY level. If you want to debate give me a try. I will not ever be in favor of any debt forgiveness at tax payers expense.  I'm on a fixed income so .... shall we begin the debate?
@FoxNews Joe so conserned about student loans pay it out of money you received from ukrain and China
@NPR ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I have the authority to do it by signing with a pen.‚Äù Joe Biden Feb 2021.   ‚ÄúPeople think the president of the United States has the power for debt forgiveness.  ... But he does not have that power. That has to be an act of Congress.‚Äù Nancy Pelosi July 2021.
@FoxNews Why is the Student Loan forgiveness bad? Education is the best investment we have for the future.
@FoxNews Student loans are made through private lenders and the POTUS cannot cancel a debt owed to another.    No one can be generous with others money.
"@FoxNews It might be legal to do what Biden wants to do with student loans, but ONLY if Congress approves it first, NOT the way he's trying to do it."
"@FoxNews I'm for student loan debt relief. If we can bail out other countries, corporations , banks, airlines , etc, they can help those with student loan debt."
@FoxNews My mortgage identified as a student loan.
"@FoxNews Remember that time when he pardoned anyone who was in prison for ""Federal Marijuana Possession charges""? About as useless as forgiving 10k in student loan debt for certain people"
"@FoxNews These are exactly the items of data this man should have everyday.  With our country is such disarray you would think he would know these thins.  But, he doesn‚Äôt. He goes to Delaware almost every week. Lies to get votes I.e. student loan debt paid.  All publicity for votes"
@FoxNews Why don‚Äôt we go after the start of the problem? Fight against the universities and their extremely high tuitions. That would reduce the burden on everybody. Then change the student loan industry. Why are we letting them win masked by helping people with student debt.
@FoxNews Gee All through The years everybody I knew that went to college and got student loans and stuff they had to pay their own loans off how come this this generation of people get a pass get a damn job and go pay your own bills
@FoxNews There is no right answer to whether they should or shouldn't forgive Student Loans. We all know this is a measure to create more inflation. It has nothing to do with politics. Blame the banks not one another.
@FoxNews I can‚Äôt see any reason why people making minimum wage should be burdened with these people‚Äôs debt forgiveness. We all need to pay our own way!!!
"@FoxNews Well, if your doing that. Well I need you to pay me back my student loan over 45  years, with interest."
@FoxNews How do we go about suing for those PPE loans that were forgiven?  If we can‚Äôt forgive student loan debt because it‚Äôs a burden to the taxpayers then how can PPE loans be forgiven?
@FoxNews What have Americans been splurging on? Are you sure that the government hasn‚Äôt been supporting? Free money via stimulus checks or debt forgiveness etc
@FoxNews There is no student loan fairy or grant fairy.  If you borrow money pay it back . If you're smart enough to get into college you should've read your loan agreement. Personal responsibility and character is what it comes down to.
"@FoxNews Thank you President Biden, for helping students with student loan debt."
"@FoxNews I worked hard to pay off my student loans with my degree, very thankful was able to get a loan however it was my loan to pay off , I learned that you are responsible for your own debt"
@NPR Get all these rich people who illegally  took millions of dollars of PPP loans and got them all 100% cancelled to give the money back!!!! That money could pay off student loans that had interest rates changed and tinkered with in other fraudulent ways!!!
@FoxNews Nobody should make money on these student loans. The answer to all this nonsense is 0% interest
"@FoxNews You should just cancel everyone's student loans who makes under $100,000 a year"
@FoxNews Your a booble head Joe ! You can‚Äôt do the student loan bail out it has to go through the house and senate
@FoxNews How about the government gives them 0% interest on their student loans for 2+ years vs having every tax payer to pay off the debt
@FoxNews I PAID MY STUDENT LOAN OFF THESES STUDENTS CAN PAY THEIR OWN LOANS OFF JUST LIKE EVERYONE BEFORE THEM STOP TRYING TO BUY VOTES DEMENTIA JOE BRANDON BIDEN
@FoxNews That's the problem. Let's just give everyone under 30 student debt forgiveness... Better yet let's just make education in the United States free to everyone that is a citizen of the United States.
@FoxNews Remember the 2008 bail outs for businesses? That was Republican President Bush. Some big businesses took advantage of that. I don't remember many complaining then. I have no problem with college debt forgiveness.
@FoxNews It‚Äôs NOT fair to payoff student loans period! They took out these loans knowing they had to repay their debts now Mt them@out on there big girl/boys panties and pay their debts back just like every American before and after them@has and will have to do! The pandemic and HEROES
"@FoxNews I paid my student loans, now pay yours and stop freeloading on taxpayers. Dam bunch of lazy losers!"
"@FoxNews The problem here is the ignorance of people.  You have no issue with corporate welfare but student loan forgiveness has your panties twisted.  Looking at the loudest whiners, I'd say the problem isn't a ""what"" issue as much as it is a ""who"" issue."
"@NPR ICYMI - ""People think that the president of the United States has the power for debt forgiveness. He does not. He can postpone. He can delay. But he does not have that power. That has to be an act of Congress.""  @SpeakerPelosi , July 2021.  She was right."

"@FoxNews @POTUS should have determined, unequivocally, if paying student loan debt was legal BEFORE he announced it. He created hope for so many, which may be shattered. It was clearly a vote getting move‚Äîand it worked. A real CEO would be fired for this."
@FoxNews Legal my a** president Biden is trying to cover his tracks on something and  He's using the student loan as a cover up don't fall for it hes gonna do something say hes paying for something and then turn around and you're gonna have to pay double back what hes paid watch your a**

@FoxNews Likely get more support from the GOP if the student loan was looking at being reformed so they are less predatory and unreasonable instead of taking money from Peter to pay Paul.
"@NPR You lied knowing you could not pay for student loans without congressional approval, how about raising the pay for the military, how about the homeless vets? All you are doing is buying votes. Can‚Äôt wait til January when the GOP stops all this waste."
@NPR I don't recall voting for debt forgiveness this f****** thing is illegal stop it
"@FoxNews What about the people who did the right thing, who saved and worked their asses off to further their education without the need of student loans, will they be reimbursed for all that effort?? If you want to further your education that is your own responsibility."
@FoxNews LOL...sure consumers spent their COVID funds or money not sure to repay student loan debt for example. People are not saving the funds for an emergency fund!
"@FoxNews Here is the Elephant in the Room. Biden could care less about those individuals who owe college debt. He is only pushing this, for his own benefit. The Financial institutions holding college debt at lower interest rates. Wanting to reduce student loans, for higher interest loans."
@FoxNews   regarding student loans Biden said those checks will be going out in two weeks. What the fuck is he talking about?
@FoxNews What about the next group of student loans 2 years from now?   The government is supposed to be for ALL the people. Not a small group (45million)  America has 340 ish million folks.  Seems like a  30 BILLION ars kiss
"@FoxNews This s a misnomer, Student loans cannot be bankrupt."
@FoxNews @RNC @GOPLeader @JesseBWatters @jimmyfailla @greggutfeld Biden bought the youth vote lieing about student loan forgiveness. 2024 Repubs promise elimination of income tax! And free gas!
@FoxNews Then pay everyone who has or had student loans. There are those that did without to payback their loans! You you do for one they you do for all! Not fair to help only a few!!!
"@nytimes congress should pass a law disallowing civil judgments to be discharged in bankruptcy like federal student loans.  If he can't afford to pay, garnish all future income until the debt is paid."
"@FoxNews Biden's student loan forgiveness plan was simply a ploy to get midterm votes. They knew if was not legal but their plan worked, fooling countless thousands of voters."
@FoxNews The thing that cracks me up is that people act like this is some new thing. All the focus all the sudden goes to this and people fight it. There has always been student loan forgiveness.
@NPR Pay your own student loans!
"@FoxNews Vis-√†-vis Vaccination mandates, drug price negotiation, student loans &amp; the mother of all human stupidity.. the US ‚Äú defense budget‚Äù, while SOMEHOW being ok with Privately owned banks loaning out govt the $ it‚Äôs Constitutionally empowered to create."
@FoxNews Those students are fully aware that Republican appointed judges are blocking Biden's college debt forgiveness.
"@FoxNews The results of student loan forgiveness long-term could be interesting.  If lenders are left holding the bag, then they‚Äôll never make loans for unprofitable degrees again. I‚Äôm kidding of course‚Ä¶this will fall on tax payers."
@FoxNews Everyone knows the student debt forgiveness is illegal.Get real Warnock Who you trying to play now?SMH....
"@FoxNews Yes, lie to the students make it seem the student debt forgiveness is a done deal; all you have to do is vote for me and I'll make it happen; the check will be in the mail you'll have nothing to worry about. You can trust me on this. A snake oil salesman by any other name Warnock"
@FoxNews You have been played. Student debt forgiveness wasxand is a democrap scam to trick you people for votes.
"@FoxNews Ha on the free money, inflated Unemployment compensation, stopping rents, payments to student loans etc!"
@FoxNews Is he offering to pay student loans off to just vote Warnock?
"@FoxNews Another lie from Hell's own politician, Warnock. Student loan forgiveness is dead."
@nytimes What about slurs against people that don't have student loans outstanding?
@FoxNews Biden has no authority to give debt forgiveness. Tell the whole truth about college debt! You sign a contract to borrow the money and pay it back! It‚Äôs your responsibility not anyone else‚Äôs. Pay your debts. Most students want to use the money for travel not to pay their debt.
@FoxNews FYI there is no debt forgiveness for college students and ther won‚Äôt be any in the future  . Biden lies as usual
@FoxNews But debt forgiveness won't happen.  Another lie from Democrats.
@MSNBC And no student loan relief lol
@FoxNews Warnock sounds manipulative just like Joe Biden! And the student loan forgiveness is never going to go through the supreme Court.... It's a rouse to get young voters. That's all it is!
"@FoxNews Listen unfortunately the college debt forgiveness won‚Äôt be available since it was not properly approved and gone through the proper channels , so again these people are voting because they think they are getting money and fooled again when they need to vote the better leader"
@FoxNews Student Debt forgiveness was a fraud. It was a bribe to get them to vote Dem.  No that Supreme Court said it was an overreach and Stopped it. Would those who voted because of it change their way of  voting. This was Voter Interference
"@FoxNews Hey I have a $20,000 credit card bill why can't that get paid I'm a taxpayer with hardship due to the covid bullcrap lockdowns. And back in the day I worked three jobs to pay for my student loan for 10 years and they're supposedly so many jobs low unemployment"
@FoxNews Warnock knows the student loan bailout is unconstitutional unless passed by congress.
"@FoxNews yep, some are eating up the empty promise of student loan forgiveness.  Doubtful it makes it past the Supreme Court."
"@FoxNews Any lie the Dems give has to sound like $$$ to poor people. The problem is student debt forgiveness of up to $10,000 won't be helpful to those poor students. It's too small an amount to pay for a college education in a full-term college in the USA. It's sad to see the deceit."
@FoxNews Student loan forgiveness is illegal. Pay your loan that you gave your word you would pay back.
"@FoxNews 1. Stop wasting billions of our money to support Ukraine. 2. When you stop it, spend it to fix our health system. Then, if something left, cover student loans of those who demonstrated high achievements."
@FoxNews Student loan is   one be fraud  from Biden and this  lying man
"@FoxNews Lies, lies, lies!  College debt forgiveness by Biden is unconstitutional!"
"@FoxNews @JesseBWatters Like Bidens student loan relief,  he is using this as he wants to run for president."
@FoxNews @JesseBWatters Buying votes like Biden with student loans
@nytimes that‚Äôs two student loan debts squashed‚Ä¶.
@FoxNews College Debt Forgiveness....  More Democrat False Promises in an attempt to buy votes.
@FoxNews He's blowing smoke hoping they will still believe their student loans will be cancelled Biden has no authority to forgive the loans.... Smoke and mirrors
@FoxNews The debt forgiveness was a lie! Biden doesn't have the power! Supreme court has agreed to hear the Case next year So there may be a decision by June 2023.
@FoxNews Get a job and pay your own damn student loan
@FoxNews See... again they are lying. Biden is just proposing the student loan forgiveness and blocked by Supreme Court right away this politician is telling lies already so he can get votes. Can anyone tell the truth already? Can they tell people the truth?
@FoxNews He is a liar ü§• !! Even Nancy Pelosi said Biden has No authority to forgive any student loans . It is against the law and even Pelosi will not let him!! Stop üõë your lies!! He is suppose to be a man of God but he is a man of Satan!!
"@FoxNews SO, warnock is willing to pay some of YOUR CONTRACTED student loan debt off? wonderful running statement.  I prefer not to give you 1 cent for your edu! COVER YOUR OWN ASS!"
@FoxNews Why the government is even in the student loan business is ridiculous. To forgive the loans only makes a cash transfer from the pockets of the working class to a wealthier elite class.
"@FoxNews Buying votes. How about paying off my mortgage.  I paid off my student loan,????.."
@FoxNews Any word on the @HerschelWalker abortion debt forgiveness program for his ex girlfriends? üëÇü§°
"@FoxNews But it‚Äôs been stopped, the reason for the debt forgiveness was to get votes in reality so is that a lie he is fostering in his stumping then?"
@FoxNews I urge all of you young student voters to read the Constitution. You will find that Congress controls the purse strings not the president.Biden is  Flat out lying about being able to forgive any student loans.All he wants is your votes to keep his corrupt  regime in power.
"@FoxNews Freebies, buying votes by bankrupting the country. Republicans should promise full debt forgiveness and 100,000 dollars to every citizen"
"@FoxNews Looks like gun control and student loan relief are totally dead.  If you can't afford college, then DON'T GO."
@FoxNews If you forgive this student loans then forgive and refunds all other loans from the starting of America!. Deceiving political is not healthy.
@FoxNews Warnock is trying to win votes by pushing an agenda that Biden had no authority to mandate. Student loan forgiveness  does not qualify for something that is a national emergency
@FoxNews We have been telling you for years: THERE WILL BE NO MASS STUDENT DEBT FORGIVENESS.    It is not a Republican led movement to sue against it and it is not within the presidents power without Congress and Congress will not do it either. Notice how a judge ruled day after mid term?
@FoxNews Why should American taxpayers have to pay for student loans?
"@FoxNews Fool me ü§£ü§£ once, fool me twice for my vote? I don't think so! Biden out of his 'Executive' league in ordering student loan forgiveness! Under the Constitution of the U.S. the power 4 student loan forgiveness belongs to 'Congress'!"
@FoxNews Amazing Warnock is of course promoting the Big Lie that Biden was using to buy votes in the Mid-term elections. His canceling of student loan debt is not a power he has as the money for this lie is not within his power to spend.
@FoxNews Warlocks is lying to get the young voters your not getting you student loan money back or paid
@FoxNews Student loan forgiveness probably won't survive a court challenge but vote for me because of student loan forgiveness that I had no part in implementing. Typical leftist making empty promises in search of low information votes.
"@FoxNews Paid my last student loan bill 2 days ago. It wasnt easy to continue to pay it but I did throughout the pandemic. I signed up to borrow it, I paid it back. Others can do the same. CNBC did a poll and 73% say if it passes they will travel snd eat out. WTF? Pay your debts deadbeats"
"@FoxNews I only went to 5th grade. I should get a rebate.  Will Joe Biden pay off my van loan, buy me new kayaks? No...but I have to absorb paying off the peoples student loans who got the better paying jobs. Ha! Now I understand why Joe Biden figures the Gov. Needs 82,000 new IRS agents."
"@FoxNews THE DEBT FORGIVENESS THING IS DEAD, AND WARNOCK IS LOSING."
@FoxNews They should have colleges and universities lower their prices. It's stupid and ridiculous to pay for student loans that isn't fair to everyone
"@FoxNews There is no reason to make people who never took out student loans pay for other people who make poor financial decisions. If you go to college, make sure you get a useful degree."
@FoxNews Debt forgiveness will never happen!
@FoxNews This is the reason why Republicans are using their pocket judges to block student loan forgiveness
@FoxNews Too bad these gullable youngsters don't know that the debt forgiveness will more than likely NEVER happen...smh
@FoxNews It's not debt forgiveness!  It is #debtredistribution! And college kids are clueless for the most part and will believe this rhetoric without even looking any further for the truth. Talk about #disinformation and #ElectionInterference interference!
@FoxNews So remember out there every time a republican senator or Congress person shoes as in the case of the student loan forgiveness program that money comes out of your pocket they make a big deal out of 40 billion Afghanistan cost us 1 billion a day for 22 years
@FoxNews student loan debt forgiveness is a sham. You would think college-educated students would know that a president has no constitutional power to do it.
@FoxNews Just think about it how outrageous is that a couple making $249K a year can still qualify for a student loan forgiveness and we are paying for it
"@FoxNews Yes, the republican‚Äôs bill for student loan forgiveness is much better. ü§°"
"@FoxNews Dems use student loans, soft on crime, and anti large corporations to lure young folks, what do Republicans use? Maybe safety? We‚Äôve got a problem."
@FoxNews There is nothing conservative about opposing student loans  Student loans are bloated government spending putting the cost on your kids
"@FoxNews What a crock! Biden and his liberal operatives KNEW the alleged ""Student Loan Debt Forgiveness"" charade would be challenged in the U.S. Courts &amp; probably be stopped because only Congress has power to approve/disapprove, NOT the President. Biden even said  it possibly wasn't legal"
@FoxNews I don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs going to be any student loan forgiveness.
"@FoxNews Good strategy. Self-centered college graduates will fall for it. To hell with the country, I need my student loan forgiven."
@nytimes Turn off the interest. There's no way in this world I'm ever going to be able to pay off my student loan. And with the balance being what it is I would never be able to refinance it.
@FoxNews It's all the interest charges put on student loans that is the biggest problem that no one is talking about. My 52k turned into 99k
"@FoxNews The president of the United States doesn't have the legal right to forgive student loans period. This was just a shell game to get votes, but all the believers don't realize it. So sad."
"@FoxNews Hello Warnock, Biden‚Äôs student loan forgiveness isn‚Äôt legal. You guys need to stop bribing the American people and start telling them the truth."
"@FoxNews Many people that voted thinking they would get there student loans forgiven feel lied to now, it was just a trick to begin with like fishing with bait, there's not only a hook but a fisherman ready to eat you or sell you."
"@FoxNews No wonder people can't get a job with their college degree and can't pay off their student loans. If they are still believing this student loan forgiveness CON. As the saying goes ""fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me"""
@FoxNews Biden‚Äôs college debt forgiveness is unconstitutional. He has no presidential authority on the matter‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the job of congress
@FoxNews I wonder how many students would vote for Herschel if they knew Biden's student loan scam is illegal and will be deemed so in the SCOTUS?
@FoxNews Student loan forgiveness will never see light of day...Pay your own debits !!
"@FoxNews Fake news.. won't happen, it's a voting ploy... just like student loans won't be paid by biden"
"@FoxNews Everything comes out in time. Joe Biden does not have the power to forgive up to $20,000 in student loans. That would have to go through Congress and it‚Äôs never going to happen. It was a bad idea from the very start."
"@FoxNews It amazes me that they keep believing the lies and voting for these crooks. Just like student loan relief, it is a scam. LOL."
@FoxNews This is like student loan forgiveness. Politicians just giving away Americans hard earned money to buy votes.
@FoxNews Scam to get votes just like student loan debt
@FoxNews Make Harvard pay for student loan forgiveness!! They should be put out of business!
"@FoxNews This is an election ploy for when he runs for president, just like Biden promised student loan forgiveness."
@FoxNews + we should forgive all their student loans?
"@FoxNews I hope Black people do not fall for this, in much the same way former students thought their student loans were going to be cancelled.  The govt does not get to steal my money and give it to other people."
"@FoxNews Could be another ""Student loan forgiveness"" too. LMAO suckers!!"
"@FoxNews Ah yes, the good old switch-a-roo to buy votes. They all knew Student loan forgiveness was never going to pass, but they did it anyways. Newsom knows this is never going to happen, but sure does sound good.  Both failures blamed on evil Republicans."
@FoxNews All smoke and mirrors just like the student loan forgiveness. They want to sway certain people to vote democrat for the next election. I guarantee this won't go through. Why? Because for over 30 years it's been at this point and never happened. Keep on being used up and bamboozle
@FoxNews WTF really??? Buying votes.                                  Student loan forgiveness                  Open border                            Reparations
@FoxNews Debt forgiveness is another Evil Lie to get a demographic group trapped into voting for the Democrats. #EvilLiesAndConfusion
"@FoxNews The ultra left wing liberal is trying to buy votes the same way Biden tried with his unconstitutional action on the student loan waiver. With them, the desired result is justifiable by any means used."
@FoxNews Lol I‚Äôm guessing this is gonna be like student loan forgiveness. Never actually come to fruition. Just mentioned long enough to win some votes.
"@FoxNews How freaking obvious is this crap? I thought biden's proposal to cancel student loans was the epitome of vote buying. He can't hold a candle to newsom. This is just another dem saying he has to take care of the plantation's chilluns. Hows it feel to be auctioned, again?"
"@FoxNews That's not gonna happen. Biden has never had the power to forgive Government student loans. This is why it isn't going anywhere. That bill will be dead in a few months. It isn't worth the paper or time it took to write it. Worthless, just more lies and propaganda to get votes."
@FoxNews There is no debt forgiveness
@FoxNews Yet you have people complaining about the student loan bailout lol.
@FoxNews Just another bait and switch like the student loan payoff scam. They are trying to get the African American vote back
@FoxNews Any student who votes for Warnock bc of student loan forgiveness YOU ARE BEING USED!  This will never come to pass it is unconstitutional.

@FoxNews Never going to happen it's just a way for Democrats to lie to voters to get votes. Just like the unconstitutional student loan payouts. That would only benefit over priced collages
"@FoxNews Selling false hope on vote buying just like Joe did during the midterms. They both know just as Pelosi made it clear that student loan relief must go through constant not a executive order. I guess they didn‚Äôt teach that in grammar school, JR high, H.S or college anymore."
@FoxNews Just a DemLibCommieNazi party con-artist thug scheme like student loan forgiveness to retain black vote!!!  New some is a scheming con-artist thug!!!
@FoxNews Absolutely absurd.  This wil NEVER happen.  Newsome looking for the black vote just like Biden knew student debt forgiveness was illegal. It's all about the vote.
"@FoxNews All lefties when running for office. Promise to give away freebies Chris, they never turn out to be exactly what they say!!   Remember Joe Biden saying he was going to do away with student loan debt. Wipe it out?"
"@FoxNews That's a little steep to pay for votes. Might try a lower monthly amount perpetually without the back pay, and that way you can stop it at any time like the student loan, before it begins"
"@FoxNews So desperate to win, Warnock's promising student debt forgiveness to echo Biden's false narrative. Anything for votes, treating student voters as though they are too stupid to realize the truth. Right from the democratic playbook, just say what they want to hear, truth or not"
@FoxNews Warnock there be no debt forgiveness
@FoxNews debt forgiveness is a fantasy. Nobody in their right mind should believe this.
@FoxNews As a tax payer I should not have to pay back student loans i worked 2 jobs to pay mine off they should do the same
@FoxNews Don't hold your breath. No way can debt forgiveness be given by the President. Congress controls the purse strings. You are going to have to pay your own loan. Just like anyone else that borrows money!
"@FoxNews I thought Democrats were going to fix the infrastructure. Oh, that was just a lying promise to get votes, just like the student loan promise. Never gonna happen."
@FoxNews There's no student loans forgiveness it hasn't made a pass of single court what makes you think it'll make it pass the Supreme Court
@FoxNews I heard that Student Debt forgiveness can not be passed as it is Un-Constitutional
"@FoxNews Larry, have you tried offering student loan forgiveness.  Seems to be working in other parts of the country.  Signed Joe Biden and Rapheal Warnock."
@FoxNews Didn‚Äôt Biden try this with student loans.
@FoxNews So Warnock is campaigning on a lie that will never come to fruition. Student Loan Debt will Not be forgiven. Where's the IRS in this by the way? Yep that's definitely someone I want in Congress. Don't you??
@FoxNews Student loan debts should be a refund from negligent institutions of higher learning. They failed not society! RIP once great republic
"@FoxNews Scotus is going to put an end to this moronic student loan crap. Stop lying to these people, you know it's never ever ever ever going to happen."
@FoxNews Just like student loan debt right. SMH that will be a taking point just pander drag it out and forget
@FoxNews Newsome knows this will be overturned by the Supreme Court. Just like the student loan thing Biden pushed. He playing politics. It will be overturned ‚Ä¶then he blames republicans. Oh‚Ä¶see here my evidence that Republicans are racist‚Ä¶ they keep playing games.
"@FoxNews This is just another ""Buy-Your-Vote"" (BYV) scam. Just like the Student Loan Debt forgiveness plan. It will be brought to the courts and determined to be illegal and the reparations will never be paid. Wake up y'all! Just sayin'."
@FoxNews This is buying votes for democrats in California just like student loan. All this causes is racial hate that America divide.
"@FoxNews What a LIE, just like student loan forgiveness and DACA"
@FoxNews you can't believe him it's just like Biden cancelling student loan debt I think he knew he couldn't do it but wanted the votes for the mid terms.
"@FoxNews Rev. Warnock can‚Äôt run on dem policy or his voting record so he misleads voters on the student loan exec order that has been shot down by the courts, and was a Biden midterm tactic. GA voters don‚Äôt fall for this snake-oil salesperson. Vote Walker!"
"@FoxNews He is a murderer! My family fought in Afghanistan and Biden turned his back on us. In border crisis, in false student loans,making us oil beggars while we have the most oil, job loss. No one wants to work. He has created global havoc. Impeach Biden!"
@FoxNews Another bait for black votes like the student loan forgiveness was to kids?
@FoxNews as it should.........plus all the people he lied to about their student loans
@NPR All I know is my student loan was the first thing I paid after graduating.I do think education should be free.
@FoxNews Biden has the msm covering for him and suppressing negative stories. Biden buys votes through reparations and student loan relief. Biden gains votes by labeling minorities as victims. Biden gets votes by demonizing Trump.
@FoxNews He‚Äôs going to pay reparations the same way Biden did the student loans. Buying votesüòÇüòÇüòÇüôåüèª
@FoxNews If they are trying to forgive student loans they should not still be backing new loans.  This is a voting gimmick for Biden and Warnock.  Taxpayers lose again!
"@FoxNews This is how Needsome is preparing for a presidential run; it‚Äôs a democrat lie, but just like they promised to pay off student loans it mobilizes a voting block.  Some people will fall for anything.  A sucker born every minute"
@FoxNews Student loan debt payoff was a bribe that Biden knew he would never have to pay because he didn't have legal authority.
"@FoxNews This will be paid right after Biden pays off all the student loan debt he promised to. I'm other words, don't hold your breath."
@FoxNews What did you do expect he's a Democrat politician all they wanted is your vote and once they get  You're vote you're nothing to them.until the next election and then they will act like they're on your side. just like student loan program. To be continued
@FoxNews Just like those kids thinking they're gonna get money for student loans they aint gonna get nothing and the democrats will promise them again at the next election and those kids would be stupid enough to fall for it again  Democrats care nothing more than power.
"@FoxNews The new way democrats buy votes is to offer something they will never deliver if you will just vote for them. Like Joe Biden‚Äôs vote for me and I‚Äôll give you $10,000-$20,000 on student loans. He knows he can‚Äôt deliver but that doesn‚Äôt matter. You will have already voted by then."
@FoxNews Just like student loan forgiveness rotflmao
@FoxNews Now my mortgage identifies as a student loan and I am now going to identify as a Black man.
"@FoxNews Oh, Biden turned his back on the rail union? That's nothing. College kids turned out in droves to vote after Biden promised to forgive student loans. They got screwed too. Didn't get a sniff, did you?"
@FoxNews Just like fake student loan forgiveness.
@FoxNews Man that‚Äôs some expensive vote buying.  That‚Äôs pricier than student loan forgiveness.
@FoxNews This is sounding eerily similar to we will forgive your student loan debt.   Charlie Brown and Lucy with the football Part II for 2024 votes!!!
@FoxNews We need to pay off this guy's student loan debt so he won't be so angry
"@FoxNews Looks like somebody‚Äôs running for President! I‚Äôm sure y‚Äôall will receive those ‚Äúreparations‚Äù right after ya get the $10,000 for the Student Loan forgiveness!#wakeup"
"@FoxNews That's our money he wants to use to pay off student loans. It's not forgiving a thing. It's just moving the debt to our pockets. It's not enough he's passing out our money to the Ukraine people. Remember, there are no earmarks on that money. Who knows where it is going.Say NO!"
@CNN Can you overturn my student loans first though????
@FoxNews Yeah just like the student loan forgiveness!
@FoxNews Yeah... no... I'm not paying anything extra for that barista's $200K PoliSi or Gender studies or Humanities student loans. If they want to earn a living wage then they probably need to be doing something other than taking a coffee order.
@FoxNews I'm sure they'll drop that student loan lawsuit for $10k/$20k and make that happen before they shell out $233k
@FoxNews If they have student loans they got burned twice.
@FoxNews Insanity...Another 'viture tease' like student loans to luck in votes for 2024.. Never going to happen.
@FoxNews I‚Äôm just going to go ahead and move to California and knock out these student loans
@FoxNews Lol just like student loans all lies #ü§°
@FoxNews It's not debt forgiveness.  It's debt transfer
@FoxNews THIS is how you buy votes. COVID-19 payments (from taxpayers). Student loan forgiveness (transfer debt to taxpayers). Reparations (from taxpayers).
"@FoxNews Just another lie to get votes!  Remember student loan forgiveness, cancelled after midterms‚Ä¶.."
@FoxNews Looks alot like Student Debt Forgiveness. A carrot on a stick. Buying votes is getting expensive.
"@FoxNews Not only is this ridiculous, it's irresponsible. Is this really good for the country or is it just good for the democrats. How did they quantify that number anyway? Newsome is just buying votes the way Biden did with student loan forgiveness."
@FoxNews They have no money for this. Gaslighting at its best. Probably pull a Biden and at the last moment and won‚Äôt pay off student loans because it‚Äôs actually illegal!ü§™
"@FoxNews If CA wants to do this with their money, the rest of the country should let them.  We can see how it turns out.  Might not want to move now to CA to not miss out because I think the probability any money is ever paid out is low.  Kind of like student loan forgiveness."
"@FoxNews Newsome still has his eyes on a presidential race hand he‚Äôs come up with a better idea to buy votes than Biden‚Äôs student loan forgiveness, hand every Black American a wad of cash."
@FoxNews Looks like we have a new  ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to cancel your student loans‚Äù pandering fake promise. It‚Äôll be interesting to see if folks fall for it. Something tells me they will. üòÇ
@FoxNews Biden promised to give $10K for Student Loans was the biggest vote buying scheme in history.   Gov Newsom says hold my Beer.
"@FoxNews Once again, the Democrats are trying to buy the black vote, when they know damn well the proposal would never pass‚Ä¶ just like student loan debt relief!"
@FoxNews Explain to me how we are to pay these reparations &amp; others student loans &amp; other countries climate change??  You progressive types say it so easily. But we know you‚Äôre out to take away everything those of us whose families &amp; we have done to create the best country in the world.
"@FoxNews Surprised you fools. Maybe next you strike before a major election, just a thought. Ask the kids who were getting 10k from student loans how trustworthy of a politician your guy Joe is."
"@FoxNews Another example of a corrupt government redistributing the people's personal wealth. This is theft, just like student loan forgiveness. Maybe the people of #California will start voting RED if this passes. I hope so, because I don't want those quacks moving to MY State!"
@FoxNews another empty promise to buy votes... much like the student loan forgiveness unicorn.
@FoxNews Kinda like paying off student loans. These people are flipped
@FoxNews Slavery is over. Has been over. Is this money going to those long dead? This is like Biden's Student Loan forgiveness. I paid off all of my student loans and I wasn't getting any of that forgiveness. Same applies here.
@FoxNews I guess enough Black Californians have stopped voting for Democrats that they feel they need to bribe them to do so.  Kind of like Ol‚Äô Joe‚Äôs student loan forgiveness scam.
"@FoxNews Who's paying for all this, the rest of America, why only Californian's. Sounds like Biden's student loan promise scam."
"@FoxNews Here we go again selling black people dreams for their vote, once they get your vote, you get the excuses why reparations won‚Äôt happen,, just like Roe V Wade, &amp; student loan forgiveness"
@FoxNews Trying to buy black votes for 2024 run.. just like student loan forgiveness.. an attempt at legally bribing for votes
"@FoxNews Warnock talks about giving students $10,000 for student loans, which was struck down as illegal by a court, while campaigning on their campus. BUT they must vote for him to get it. Sounds like a bribe.....hmmmm just like Biden did before 2022 election. A pattern?"
@FoxNews The college debt forgiveness IS AGAINST THE LAW.
@CNN @CNNSotu Of course he did not say that!  Biden however is bypassing the constitution with his rent forgiveness and student loan forgiveness. He knows it‚Äôs unlawful and does not care and neither does CNN
"@FoxNews In terms of voter manipulation (buying), this is no different than the Biden student loan relief bill."
@FoxNews That‚Äôs the new Student Loan Forgiveness carrot
"@FoxNews Crap. He needs a national platform for his presidential run. Everyone knows he's too busy screwing employees wives to care about black people. its like biden promising student debt forgiveness, he can't do it but it makes headlines."
@FoxNews And does she expect her student loans forgiven at tax payers expense?
@FoxNews He‚Äôs doing the same thing Biden did. He‚Äôs saying what he wants but it will never get approved just like student debt forgiveness that did not get approved. He does not have the power to do that people do not believe this.
@FoxNews Another political ploy - Newsom dangling the carrot for reparations- a guaranteed debacle - just like Biden promising student loan forgiveness. How long before they collapse the US economy?
"@FoxNews I'm all in for debt forgiveness and for working class citizens to get needed help snd relief. Why not? Our government helps the 1%, Big Pharma  corporations, NRA,... WHY NOT AMERICANS, struggling in debt, in search of the American dream..  come on now... lighten up...."
"@FoxNews @ScottWa91433575 Just buying votes on a plan you know will never happen, like student loans. It‚Äôs the new Leftist method."
@FoxNews Yet they freeze the student loan forgiveness
@FoxNews He will promise like Biden did with student loans knowing it will never happen. But it will be good for a few million votes for the unsuspecting. What a shame . That‚Äôs like all cars will be electric by 2035 never going to happen he knows it by then he will be long gone.
@FoxNews But no student loan forgiveness. This country is fucked
@FoxNews He cannot pass the bill to approve student loan forgiveness he is lying ! Just like Biden!
@FoxNews This is no different than the student loans forgiveness that was only used to buy the youth vote even though Biden knew it wasn't constitutional. Now Gavin is trying to buy the black vote with promises of reparations!
@usedgov still waiting for a reply on my application for student loan forgiveness?
@FoxNews This is what is called buying the Black Vote for the 2024 Presidential Election. The same thing that Joe Biden is doing with the Student Loan cancellation. WE can no longer Trust Politicians with out Tax  Money.
@FoxNews Yep a record in high gas prices border crossing inflation industry layoffs National and International embarrassments baby formula shortage lying about the trip to Saudi Arabia the Railroad Strike student loan and most importantly being the crappiest president in American history
@FoxNews The loan debt forgiveness was a marketing ploy to make young people want to vote for the Democrats so they can get their debt forgiven. While the rest of us paid for it
@FoxNews I wish I was black so tax payers can give me their money based on the colour of my skin.  Tax payers get to pay for my student loans too.    You got to love Democrats rolling out insane unrealistic proposals and Republicans have to explain the realities.  Dems trap Republicans...
"@FoxNews Democrats are making EVERYONE pay for their crimes against humanity....  That money should come from the DNC bank, not the taxpayer... Isn't this unconstitutional? just like the student loan forgiveness crap?"
@FoxNews Another way to buy votes. If one were to have a student loan they may be able to double dip. Still another way to buy votes!
@FoxNews This is what the Democrats new con is for 2024. To get the blacks to vote for them. Same playbook as student loan forgiveness. Judge will rule against reparations after 2024 election is over.  Sound familiar?  Ps. Let's ask the students how that worked out for them.
@FoxNews What about every relative descended from everyone as far back as can be traced? Are new born African American babies given a $223k bank account? You see this gets ridiculous. Just like student loans this is buying votes.
@FoxNews Ok go for it buddy! How long will this go on years just this generation? Your buying votes just like joe did with student loans !
"@FoxNews Dems have bought votes before (see Automakers bailout and Student Loan ‚Äúforgiveness‚Äù), but never at this high a price tag!"
@FoxNews And Little Joey called to cancel student loans to get the 20 year olds to vote...moving the DNC primary from Iowa to SC...Gavin is handing out 1/4 million dollar checks...begs to question just how bad and unpopular their policies really are
"@FoxNews They know this is won't pass, like the student loan debt crap Biden pushed for. There is another agenda and when it fails, they will just blame the republicans."
"@FoxNews Rather see student loan forgiveness for 90,000 and under not 125,000"
@FoxNews Same democratic scam as student loan illegal vote buying mess.
@FoxNews Insanity. Same griff as student loans.
"@FoxNews More vote-buying that will never happen. Just like Biden's fake ""student loan forgiveness."""
"@FoxNews dems have trampled all over and in many ways totally disregarded the Constitution, ex the southern border, the student loan handout, the vaccine mandate, and illegal gun laws in many states. Now they want to get self-righteous about honoring the Constitution; is this a joke?"
@nytimes Used in a sentence:  I‚Äôm gonna go goblin-mode and let other people pay off my student loans that I voluntarily took out for myself.   #Goblinmode
@FoxNews I'm guessing everyone on here who doesn't have usable reading skills wants their student loans forgiven?
"@FoxNews Sounds like the student loan vote buy,"
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Really?! With @POTUS offering student loan forgiveness which is totally unconstitutional. Or vax mandates also totally unconstitutional. Or attempting to ban firearms. Totally unconstitutional. @MSNBC is a hot mess. @maddow need to check herself.
@FoxNews I disagree with Trump on this one. Just like the president forgiving student loans unconstitutional is wrong no matter whose idea it is.
@MSNBC ü§£üòÇü§£ Unlike our current democracy - where our ‚Äòleader‚Äô tries to gives tax dollars to pay student loan debt without proper representation. Got it. üôÑüôÑüôÑ
"@FoxNews I don't need any bias media to tell me that the Dems want to: - forgive student loans - force vaccination - open border - restrict gun ownership  I can see those in their own speeches and policies, and that's enough for me to never listen to a Dem again."
@FoxNews He still trying to get college students to vote with the promise of student loans...Democrats will say anything to get votes...
@usedgov why are my student loans not transferring from Nelnet to Mohela?  I got approved for PSLF months ago and haven‚Äôt heard a word since July.  Can someone please do their job??
@FoxNews Just another way of screwing the taxpayers and the middle class there are no slaves alive today this is madness this is the same as paying for student loans all to screw the American people and they don't care about the homeless either
"@FoxNews The Democrats don‚Äôt seem to be trying to pass the student loan repayment bill. Well, everyone learns sooner or later how the Democrats lie to get votes. Millennials and Gen Z got played"
